# Wanderlisi — Simple admin editor

This small scaffold adds a simple login and editor to modify `tracks/notes.md`.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the server

```powershell
npm start
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000/login.html

Default credentials: admin / password (local use only — change before exposing to network)

Notes:
- The server will create `tracks/notes.md` if it doesn't exist.
- This is intentionally minimal and not hardened for production.
# Wanderlisi

The little Wander Lisi helps us to keep track of our past and next hikes.

She reads GPX tracks from the `tracks/` folder and display them on the map. As easy as this!
